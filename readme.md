## Build
 
Use the provided `Makefile` to build both components:

    -form-field: Form field name for file uploads (default: upload).
    -upload-endpoint: The path to the upload API endpoint (default: '/upload').
    -max-size: The maximum memory size (in megabytes) for storing part files in memory (default: 10).
    -read-timeout: Timeout for reading the request (default: 15s).
    -write-timeout: Timeout for writing the response (default: 15s).
    -idle-timeout: Timeout for keeping idle connections (default: 60s).
